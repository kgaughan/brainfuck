Right, a little note...

I didn't name this program, I just wrote an
interpreter for it, so those who are easily
offended had better stop here. I tried everything
short of renaming the program to attempt to avoid
offending people's sensibilities and if you are one
of these people, you can either brace yourself and
use the app or delete it now and join an enclosed
order.

You have been warned, so don't complain to me if
the program's name offends you...

And don't even open the application directory
either!
