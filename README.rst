Here's my Brainfuck interpreters for RISC OS.

You'll find the following detokenized BBC BASIC V programs in ``src``:

* ``BasicSrc.txt``: An initial BBC BASIC V interpreter for Brainfuck.
* ``BasicSrcX.txt``: A conversion of the initial BASIC interpreter to a form
  better suited to conversion to ARM Assembly language.
* ``Source.txt``: The source for a Brainfuck interpreter written in ARM
  Assembly.

Looking at this code 15 or so years later, it's not too embarrassing, and the
assembly code has some nice bits to it, but I certainly could've done better.

Also includes are ``Technical`` and ``README.orig``, which contain some
technical details and a lightly edited version of the original !Help file,
which contains a short manual. I've certainly grown up since writing that.

``programs`` contains a number of sample programs, though I'm not sure if I
wrote them or found them somewhere.

If you look at the history of this repo, you'll see the original archive,
which I checked in for posterity.

None of this is of much use to anybody these days, but I thought it might be
a fun historical artifact.
